# The following is an example of a single-processor sequential job that uses $TMPDIR as its working area.
# This batch script copies the script file and input file from the directory the
# sbatch command was called from into $TMPDIR, runs the code in $TMPDIR,
# and copies the output file back to the original directory.
#
# Move to the directory where the job was submitted
